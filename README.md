** Thank you for checking out Escape the Complex! **

!! Currently under development !!

This is a retro text adventure game, your objective is to find a way out of the strange place you have awoken in.
You'll find a few helpful NPCs along the way, and there are a couple of puzzles to solve in order to open the exit.
There are two possible ways out, one that's fairly obvious and one not so obvious.
Examining your surroundings and poking around can reveal secrets, but be careful what you poke, as some things in the Complex are dangerous!
